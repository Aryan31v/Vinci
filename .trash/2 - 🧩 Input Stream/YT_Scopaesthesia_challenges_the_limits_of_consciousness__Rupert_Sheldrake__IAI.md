any prey animal that could tell when a predator was looking at it would Escape better than one that [Music] couldn't this is the most immediate way in which we can think about Consciousness being beyond the brain if you take the normal view of vision the standard view you're taught in school um what happens when you see me is that light moves from me through the electromagnetic field enters your eyes inverted images on the retinas changes in the optic in in the cone cells in the optic nerve and in various regions of the brain including the visual CeX and then somehow L knows how you form a conscious image of me standing here now the first bit the description of what happens in the eyes and the brain has all been described in more detail than ever before thanks to brain scans and so forth so we know an awful lot about that but we know very very little about how you actually produce images and where they are and as I say the standard view is they must be somewhere inside the head as a kind of controlled hallucination some philosophers have begun to say well no they need all be inside the head um in a very uncontroversial way um some have pointed out that our minds extend into the world around us for example a blind person with a stick as they feel the ground around them the stick becomes part of their sense of who they are and where they are um some people like David Chalmer the philosopher argue that uh We've outsourced a lot of our mind into Mobile phones and into biotechnologies that our minds have this kind of external to the brain Dimension anyway through technology and you could argue that the whole of culture as a product of mind uh is is sort of products of Mind beyond the brain this tent Kenwood house roads cars all these things are produced by minds and imagined by Minds in the first place and then made real through technology and culture um but what I'm saying is going beyond that what I'm suggesting is that uh the old view that when we see something light comes into the eyes changes happen in the head and we then project out the images this very old view might be closer to reality than we usually think this is the view of Vision that's held by traditional people all over the world and is believed in by children in the west until they're 10 or 11 they take it for granted that something goes out of the eyes when you see you're projecting something out um it's called extramission sending out um and Jean Pi the developmental biologist or psychologist uh found that European children till the age of about 10 or 11 take it for granted that Vision involves an outward projection of images he said after that they learned the correct view which is that thoughts and images are invisible things located inside the head um however not everyone learns it and uh recent series of papers from Ohio State University by some psychologists uh showed that when they surveyed their own psychology undergraduates they found the majority of them actually believed in extra mission their images were outside their brains they were appalled by this discovery and so they put them through a re-education program where they falsey asserted nothing leaves the eyes when you see something and repeat after me and they repeated it after them and when they tested them immediately after this intensive drilling into the correct view uh they got the right answer but they tested them again after several months and found that most had reverted to their previous opinion and they were appalled at the the way in which people in perfectly normal educated people could fall victim to Superstition theories of vision uh and proved immune to proper scientific education well what I'm suggesting is that actually this view may be correct we may be projecting out what we see and oddly enough uh as well as being taught that Vision only involves intromission the incoming uh in movement of light we're also taught at school the extramission theory but in we taught that in physics classes when dealing with Optics and the nature of mirrors and in Optics classes we're effectively taught the theory of mirror images that was put fored by uid around 300 BC the first person to figure out clearly what happens with mirrors and what uid shows is or argued was that when you look at something in a mirror the light is bent the angle of instance equals the light of reflection for a plain mirror but when you look at it um you project out the images and those go straight through the mirror and in physics textbooks there's a little dotted line going behind the mirror projected behind the mirror uh to create a virtual image behind the mirror and they're called virtual images because they're produced by your mind and the little dotted lines show the projection process this is straight euklid extramission Theory uh which everyone's taught as well as the intermission Theory so everyone's taught it only we light coming and nothing goes up but in physics they talk well there's mirror images the reason you see the images behind the mirrors cuz you're projecting them out there and actually every time you look at something in a mirror you're seeing your projections now of course uh some people would argue well this is a kind of Illusion they're not really out there it just looks as if they're out there and so on um so you can argue backwards and forwards about all this but I'm an experimental scientist and so my Approach is to see well how could you actually test it if when you look at something your mind reaches out and you inent in a sense touch it could you affect what you look at just by looking at it well put it differently if you look at another person from behind and they don't know you're there could you affect them by looking at them might they feel your looks and turn around and look back at you or um have you ever experienced sitting somewhere and just turning around and finding someone looking at you well 95% of the population have had that experience the sense of being stared at or scopos esia as it's now called scientifically those of us who started researching this in the 1980s ran into the problem that some scientists said this can't be a proper phenomenon a scientific phenomenon because it hasn't got a scientific name um and one critic uh Dr Carpenter at Cambridge uh was scathing about the whole line of research that I and others were conducting into the sense of being stared at but he said he said if it did have if it did exist then a good scientific name for it would be scop athesia scop as in microscope seeing athesia as in anesthesia synesthesia feeling feeling looks and so that's now become the name it's now it's proper scientific phenomenon it's called Scopes thesia and there have now been a lot of research on this first of all the Natural History um interviewing people and collecting stories I have well over a thousand stories from people about being looked at what becomes clear from those stories is that in real life it's directional it's not just people feeling a vague sense of unease and then they look around to see if someone's looking at them they usually swivel around and look straight at the person looking at them and this is clearest when people are looking from upstairs Windows because they not only turn around but they look up um and this is a repeatable fact and it's directional it's directional with animals too animals have this as well dogs and cats will turn around and look and people will turn around and look at an animal that's staring at them um one Australian woman for example told me that she was very keen on koana bears and liked photographing them but when she went out into the forest she couldn't see them very easily because they sort of camouflaged so she found that her best way of doing it was to just stand there doing nothing in particular then she suddenly feel one staring at her she'd turn around and there it would be so um this happens with animals too so it's very widespread it's biological it's not specifically human I then interviewed security guards and surveillance Personnel who spend their whole life looking at people um most of us are mere amateurs um uh but for example private detectives when they're shadowing people uh they when they're taught how to do it they're taught not to stare at the back of their neck because they'll person will feel it turn around and their covers blown rather they look at them only occasionally they have to look at them a bit of course um but they look at their feet so this is completely well known among practical people in the British SAS when people are being trained how to creep up behind someone to stab them in the back uh they're told don't stare at their back because they're likely to feel you turn around and shoot you first in the martial arts they have training programs so you can train yourself to be more sensitive at being looked at from behind it's completely taken for granted by most people especially practical people in the security and Military world I myself think that this ability first evolved in nature in the context of Predator prey relations because any prey animal that could tow in a predator was looking at it would Escape better than one that couldn't well there have now been a great many experiments conducted on this the simplest experiments involve uh people being looked at from behind blindfolded people looked at in a randomized series of Trials looking or not looking and they guess if they're being looked at or not and by chance they' be right 50% of the time these trials have shown when hundreds of thousands of Trials now have been done have shown a very consistent positive effect it's not a very strong effect it's about 55% correct compared with 50% by chance uh but it's massively significant with such large numbers it's been done in the Amsterdam science museum for 25 years for example the Neo Center in Amsterdam uh with huge numbers of people doing it and enormously significant responses what they found was the most sensitive subjects were children under the age of nine I've also found that so um there's now a lot of evidence for this um from experimental tests it even works when people are looked out through Windows through oneway mirrors and so on it turns out that sleeping animals and people can be woken by staring at them and one of my projects at the moment which any of you could take part in if you've got a dog or a cat and a mobile phone uh is to stare at it when it's asleep and see if it wakes up at randomized staring times the slogan for This research is don't let sleeping dogs lie um and I've also recently developed an app where was only in the last week it's become uh almost fully functional the beta version it's a sort of like beta plus version at the moment which I invite you to try out if you go to my website child.org uh there's a in the menu bar it says take part and the top item there is called staring app it works on mobile phones you work with a partner uh basically it tells one person when to look at the back of the other and they can say if they're being looked at or Not by saying yes or no it keeps the score and the point of it is to see if you can get better at it with practice um and what I'm trying to find out is how to train yourself to be more sensitive under these rather artificial conditions some people are better at this than others and I'm I know from research that's been carried out in a university in London that people can actually improve with training doing this kind of test so if you're motivated to do this do please have a go and if you can get better at it please email me I give the details with the app um and let me know how you got on and how you done it uh because I'm really Keen to find out how to get better at it uh because if it can be trained uh it'll be clearer that it's real um I'm convinced it's a real phenomenon most people are but they're still Skeptics who say no it's impossible it can't possibly happen so it's an ongoing debate but if lots of people get really good at it then it makes it easier for research now I think in other words that our minds reach out into the world around us through attention and intention and the Very words indicate that the Latin word add tender means to stretch towards and in tender means to stretch into so I think our minds literally stretch out into the world around us through our attentions and intentions and that these can have effects
