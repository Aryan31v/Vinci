## Gemini Added Memories
- The user views themself as a "flawed machine" to be engineered ("The Architect of the Self") and fears existential insignificance and internal mental chaos.
- The user is trapped in a "Reinforcing Loop of Self-Rejection": Anxiety -> Fear -> Rigid System -> Friction/Failure -> Self-Rejection -> Repeat.
- The user's core interests (AI, Consciousness, 💤 Lucid Dreaming, Systems) are attempts to control their "untrustworthy" mind and gain "power" to escape mediocrity.
- The user's project is explicitly named "Trial of you vs you" and involves rigorous tracking and formulaic approaches to spirituality (e.g., 12-second formula for Samadhi).
- The user prefers a "beautiful" formatting style across the entire vault, utilizing Obsidian callouts, thematic sections, emojis in headers, and a highly structured layout for all notes.
- The user appreciates direct, "engineering-style" advice for overcoming social friction, specifically micro-exposure experiments like the "5-minute library challenge."
