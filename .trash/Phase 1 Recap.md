# Phase 1 Recap: The Source Code

> [!check] Status: COMPLETE
> **Objective:** Bridge the gap between "Common Sense" and "Relativity."
> **Core Insight:** The Universe is a **Geometric Structure**, not a random collection of objects.

## 🧩 1. The Nature of Time
- **The Question:** Why does Time exist?
- **The User's Insight:** The "Loki Argument" (Frozen Universe).
- **The Law:** **Time = Change (Entropy).**
- **The Victory:** If the universe freezes, Time vanishes. Therefore, Time is just the *record* of things moving from Order to Chaos.

## ⚡ 2. The Speed Limit ($c$)
- **The Question:** Why can't I go faster than light?
- **The User's Insight:** "I will never reach the last $1... Infinite Mass."
- **The Law:** **$E=mc^2$ (The Spacetime Budget).**
- **The Victory:** You have a fixed budget of speed ($c$). If you spend 100% on **Space** (Motion), you have 0% left for **Time** (Aging).
- **The Barrier:** Adding energy adds mass. At light speed, mass becomes infinite.

## 🌊 3. Gravity & Dilation
- **The Question:** Why does Gravity slow time?
- **The User's Insight:** The "Event Horizon" (Clock freezes for us, speeds up for traveler).
- **The Law:** **Gravity = Geometry (The River).**
- **The Victory:** Gravity is space "falling" into mass. Standing still on Earth is like running uphill against a current. This effort burns your "Time Budget."

## 🏗️ The Foundation for Phase 2
We now know the rules of the game.
Phase 2 (Black Holes) asks: **What happens when we break the game board?**

- **Singularity:** Where Math fails.
- **Spaghettification:** The Tidal Force.
- **The Swap:** Inside the Horizon, Space becomes Time.
