# 🧠 Part 2: Nyaya Darshana (The School of Logic)
*Founder: Maharishi Gautama | Text: Nyaya Sutra*

## The 16 Padarthas (Categories of Logic)

# ⚛️ Part 3: Vaisheshika Darshana (The School of Atomism)
*Founder: Maharishi Kanada | Text: Vaisheshika Sutra*

## The Shat Padartha (6 Categories of Existence)
Everything in the universe falls into these 6 categories:

### 1. Dravya (Substance)
The substratum where Guna and Karma reside.
**The 9 Karanas (Causal Substances):**
1.  **Prithvi** (Earth)
2.  **Jala** (Water)
3.  **Tejas** (Fire)
4.  **Vayu** (Air)
5.  **Akasha** (Ether/Space)
6.  **Kala** (Time)
7.  **Dik** (Direction/Space)
8.  **Atma** (Soul)
9.  **Manas** (Mind)

### 2. Guna (Quality)
Attributes residing in Dravya.
**The 24 Gunas:**
- *Sensory:* Rupa (Color), Rasa (Taste), Gandha (Smell), Sparsha (Touch), Shabda (Sound).
- *Physical:* Sankhya (Number), Parimana (Dimension), Prithaktva (Separateness), Samyoga (Conjunction), Vibhaga (Disjunction), Paratva (Priority), Aparatva (Posteriority), Gurutva (Heaviness), Dravatva (Fluidity), Sneha (Viscidity).
- *Mental:* Buddhi (Intellect), Sukha (Pleasure), Duhkha (Pain), Iccha (Desire), Dvesha (Aversion), Prayatna (Effort).
- *Misc:* Dharma (Merit), Adharma (Demerit), Samskara (Tendency).

### 3. Karma (Action)
Movement residing in Dravya.
1.  **Utkshepana:** Upward movement.
2.  **Avakshepana:** Downward movement.
3.  **Akunchana:** Contraction.
4.  **Prasarana:** Expansion.
5.  **Gamana:** Locomotion (General movement).

### 4. Samanya (Generality)
The class essence (e.g., "Cowness" in a cow).
- *Para Samanya:* Highest genus (Being-ness/Satta).
- *Apara Samanya:* Lower genus (Species).

### 5. Vishesha (Particularity)
What makes each atom distinct from another. (The root of the name *Vaisheshika*).

### 6. Samavaya (Inherence)
The inseparable relationship (e.g., Heat in Fire, Clay in Pot). It is eternal.

*(Note: Later texts add **Abhava** (Non-existence) as the 7th Padartha).*

### Paramanu Vada (Atomic Theory)
- Matter is composed of invisible, eternal atoms (*Paramanu*).
- 2 Atoms = 1 Dvyanuka.
- 3 Dvyanukas = 1 Trasarenu (Visible dust mote).

### Asatkaryavada (Arambhavada)
*School: Nyaya & Vaisheshika*
- **Definition:** The Effect (*Karya*) is a completely new entity (*Asat*) that did not exist in the Cause (*Karana*) before production.
- **Mechanism:** When causes come together (like clay threads), a new product (cloth) begins (*Arambha*).
- **Implication:** Creation is a real process of producing something new.
- **Analogy:** A pot is newly created from clay; it didn't exist in the clay beforehand.

### Pilupaka & Pitharapaka (Theories of Chemical Change)
*Context: Effect of Heat (Tejas) on Atoms (Paramanu)*
- **Pilupaka (Vaisheshika):** Heat breaks the object down to atoms (*Pilu*), changes their color/quality, and then recombines them into a new object. (Molecular change).
- **Pitharapaka (Nyaya):** Heat penetrates the object (like a pot/*Pithara*) and changes its color/quality without breaking it down into atoms. (Physical change).

# 🌳 Part 4: Sankhya Darshana (The School of Evolution)
*Founder: Maharishi Kapila | Text: Sankhya Karika*

## The 25 Tattvas (Elements of Reality)
The evolution of the universe from Consciousness + Matter.

### 1. Purusha (Consciousness)
- Pure awareness.
- Neither Cause nor Effect.
- Passive Witness (*Sakshi*).

### 2. Prakriti (Matter/Nature)
- The Primal Cause (*Mula Prakriti*).
- Composed of 3 Gunas: **Sattva** (Light/Balance), **Rajas** (Activity), **Tamas** (Inertia).
- Unconscious but active.

### The Evolution (Srishti Utpatti)
3.  **Mahat / Buddhi:** The Cosmic Intelligence.
4.  **Ahamkara:** The Ego / I-maker.
    - *Sattvika Ahamkara (Vaikarika):* Leads to Mind & Senses.
    - *Rajasika Ahamkara (Taijasa):* Activates the other two.
    - *Tamasika Ahamkara (Bhutadi):* Leads to Matter (Tanmatras).

### The 11 Indriyas (Senses) - From Sattvika Ahamkara
5.  **Manas:** Mind (Dual nature - Sensory & Motor).
6-10. **Jnanendriyas:** Ears, Skin, Eyes, Tongue, Nose.
11-15. **Karmendriyas:** Mouth, Hands, Feet, Anus, Genitals.

### The 5 Tanmatras (Subtle Elements) - From Tamasika Ahamkara
16. **Shabda:** Sound potential.
17. **Sparsha:** Touch potential.
18. **Rupa:** Sight potential.
19. **Rasa:** Taste potential.
20. **Gandha:** Smell potential.

### The 5 Mahabhutas (Gross Elements) - From Tanmatras
21. **Akasha:** Ether (from Shabda).
22. **Vayu:** Air (from Sparsha).
23. **Tejas:** Fire (from Rupa).
24. **Jala:** Water (from Rasa).
25. **Prithvi:** Earth (from Gandha).

## Satkaryavada (Parinamavada)
*School: Sankhya & Yoga*
- **Definition:** The Effect (*Karya*) potentially exists (*Sat*) in the Cause (*Karana*) prior to its manifestation.
- **Two Forms:**
    1.  *Parinamavada:* The cause actually transforms into the effect (e.g., Milk turning into Curd). Accepted by Sankhya.
    2.  *Vivartavada:* (See Vedanta).
- **Arguments:** You cannot get oil from sand; you only get it from sesame seeds because oil is already in the seed.
- **Key Tenets:**
  1. The Effect exists in the Cause.
  2. Production is manifestation (*Abhivyakti*).
  3. Destruction is return to the latent state.

### Ayurvedic View: Swabhavoparamavada (Theory of Natural Destruction)
*School: Charaka Samhita*
- **Definition:** There is a cause for the production of an entity, but no cause is needed for its destruction. Destruction is natural (*Swabhava*).
- **Implication:** Death/Destruction is inevitable and automatic. Time acts as the natural destroyer.

# 🔥 Part 6: Mimamsa (Ritual) & Vedanta (Knowledge)

## Purva Mimamsa
- **Dharma:** Duty/Ritual is the supreme goal.
- **Vedas:** Are eternal and authorless (*Apaurusheya*).
- **Karma Theory:** Every action produces an invisible potency (*Apurva*) that yields fruit later.

## Uttara Mimamsa (Vedanta)
- **Brahman:** The only reality (*Sat*).
- **Jagat:** The world is appearance (*Mithya*).
- **Maya:** The power of illusion covering Brahman.
- **Panchakosha (5 Sheaths of Self):**
    1. Annamaya (Physical).
    2. Pranamaya (Vital).
    3. Manomaya (Mental).
    4. Vijnanamaya (Intellectual).
    5. Anandamaya (Bliss).

### Vivartavada (Theory of Apparent Transformation)
*School: Advaita Vedanta*
- **Definition:** The Cause merely *appears* to transform into the Effect without undergoing any real change.
- **Concept:** Brahman appears as the World (*Jagat*) due to *Maya* (Illusion).
- **Analogy:** Rope appearing as a Snake. The rope doesn't actually change; it's a superimposition.

# 🚫 Part 7: The Nastika Schools

## Charvaka (Materialism)
- **Epistemology:** Only Perception (*Pratyaksha*) is valid. Rejects Inference.
- **Metaphysics:** Only 4 Elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air). No Ether (can't see it). No Soul.
- **Ethics:** Hedonism ("Eat, drink, and be merry").
- **Dehatmavada:** The body itself is the soul. Consciousness arises from matter like fermentation makes alcohol.

## Jaina Darshana
- **Anekantavada:** Reality has infinite aspects.
- **Syadvada (Theory of Probability/Relativity):**
    - **Definition:** All judgments are conditional, holding good only in certain conditions, circumstances, or senses.
    - **Saptabhangi Naya (7 Modes of Predication):**
        1. *Syad-asti:* Maybe it is.
        2. *Syad-nasti:* Maybe it is not.
        3. *Syad-asti-nasti:* Maybe it is and is not.
        4. *Syad-avaktavyam:* Maybe it is inexpressible.
        5. *Syad-asti-avaktavyam:* Maybe it is and is inexpressible.
        6. *Syad-nasti-avaktavyam:* Maybe it is not and is inexpressible.
        7. *Syad-asti-nasti-avaktavyam:* Maybe it is, is not, and is inexpressible.
- **Triratna (Three Jewels):** Right Faith, Right Knowledge, Right Conduct.
- **Ahimsavada:** Extreme non-violence.

## Bauddha Darshana
- **Four Noble Truths:**
    1. Life is Suffering (*Duhkha*).
    2. Cause is Desire (*Duhkha Samudaya*).
    3. Cessation is Possible (*Duhkha Nirodha*).
    4. The Path (*Ashtangika Marga*).
- **Kshanikavada (Theory of Momentariness):**
    - **Definition:** Everything constitutes a stream of momentary events. Nothing lasts for more than a single moment (*Kshana*).
    - **Concept:** The flame of a lamp appears continuous but is actually a series of different flames arising and vanishing every instant.
- **Nairatmyavada:** No permanent Self/Soul. The "Self" is just a stream of consciousness.
- **Shunyavada:** Reality is Void/Empty of inherent nature.
