      2   Kriya Sharir, I BAMS(Ayurvedacharya), NCISM
Preface


          Kriya Sharir (Human Physiology) is an important subject of the BAMS program for the undergraduate
students of Ayurveda. The term sharir means ‘in the sharir’ or ‘related to the sharir’ thus Sharir Kriya deals with
the study of the human body concerning its physiological norms i.e., the functioning of the human body in its
normal state. This subject refers to the physiology and biochemistry of contemporary medical science.


          The swasthya of an individual is based on 3 pillars of the body i.e., dosha, dhatu & mala. Kriya Sharir
subject mainly deals with these 3 pillars. The basic concepts, knowledge, and applicability of Tridosha (Vata, Pitta,
Kapha), Sapta Dhatus (Rasa, Rakta, Mamsa, Meda, Asthi, Majja, Shukra), and Trimala (Mutra, Purish, Sweda) are
very important in the critical understanding of the disease. Kriya Sharir also deals with Prakriti, Strotas, Kostha,
Agni, Oja, Mana, Aahar (Basic principles of food), shatkriyakal, the system-wise study of contemporary science,
senses function and dysfunction, etc. All these fundamental topics are essential for the proper understanding of
etiopathogenesis, diagnosis of disease, and its management which will be covered in para-clinical and clinical
subjects.
          New curriculum of Kriya Sharir is designed considering cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains.
There are group discussions, workshops, field visits, and activities beyond the textbook during the practical hours
like preparation of charts, models, seminar presentations by students. Kriya Sharir subject also deals with teaching-
learning methods like role play, flipped the classroom, etc. Some assessment methods like OSPE, PBL, DOPS,
CBD, skill assessment, etc are incorporated. The main aim of the curriculum is to highlight the basic knowledge
and to give a new scientific approach to undergraduate students to develop their skills of Ayurveda and make them
competent to apply in clinical practice and research.
