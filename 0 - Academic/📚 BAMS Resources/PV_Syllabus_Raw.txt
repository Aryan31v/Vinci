PREFACE

         All Medical sciences whether ancient or modern, needs frequent updating. Acharya Vagbhata
stresses upon reform of Ayurveda according to the present time (yuganurupasandarbha). The syllabus of
Ayurveda also needs reformation for effective dissemination of principles of Ayurveda which is strongly
based on Padartavijnanam. Acharya Vagbhata says one who seeks long life should respect Ayurveda by
four strategies that are knowedge (Adhiti), comprehension(Bodha)skill(Acharana) and
Attitude(pracharana).These teaching methodologies are evolved from the ancient upanishadic way of
teaching(Adhyapanavidhi).The new principles of teaching strategies of blooms taxonomy correlate with
the ancient way of teaching and the syllabus of Padarthavijnanam has been revamped according to the
need of hour.
         Padartha Vijnanam is a unique and mandatory subject needed for learning the stream of Ayurveda.
It is the combination of science and philosophy. One can say that the science and philosophy are the two
sides of the same coin. The search behind “existence of world/self” when progresses outward it travels
the path of science and when this search is inwards it becomes philosophy. Thus, Padartha Vijnanam is
an essential base of Ayurveda education. When the foundation becomes strong building also becomes
strong.
         Padartha Vijnanam not only provides the platform to understand Ayurveda better but it also helps
the students to appreciate the moral values beneficiating them in developing the personality. As mentioned
in graduate attributes this subject helps the student to become eloquent communicator and self-directed
learner who constantly endeavors to advance knowledge and skills to improve healthcare and social well-
being.
         This syllabus reform of Padartha Vijnanam has taken care of adopting the modern teaching-
learning methodology well-merging with the ancient one. This will definitely enhance the understanding
of the subject in a better way.

        Introduction of practicals is the zest for the subject. As we all know- “I hear, and I forget. I see
and I remember. I do, and I understand”. The teaching learning process must be joyful along with lecture
methods like group discussions, debate, roleplay and PBL. They are also mentioned and the flexibility is
kept. Here in this syllabus, the activity book is introduced to induce activity-based learning. This will
definitely create the interest in the subject. There are some self-learning activities also which will induce
the thirst for the knowledge in the student. This will help the student to understand theoretical concepts in
a lucid way and also provides hands on experience
