          The primary purpose for teaching Rachana sharir to undergraduate students is to provide a
thorough understanding of the basic principles of Sharir. Gross and microscopic structure and
development of the human body in perspective of ancient and modern sciences, as well as to acquire
necessary skills. Sharir in Ayurveda also provides in depth views to concepts like Marma and srotas.
Learning of Sharir is most useful in further years in diagnosis and management of the diseases.
          Various teaching and learning methods, including didactic, demonstration, tutorial, group
discussion, seminars, Integrated Teaching (IT), Problem Based Learning (PBL), and Early Clinical
Exposure (ECE), Case-Based Learning (CBL), Virtual Dissection, and cadaveric dissection, are used to
transfer knowledge to students, and the syllabus is constructed accordingly. As a result, the students
appreciate being a part of the teaching and learning process. This will help the students to become
competent, self-assured, caring, and concerned humans capable of providing ethical medical treatment.
