                                             PREFACE
       The main purpose of Samhita teaching is to enable the students to read, understand and practice
the Samhitas. Samhita is nothing but an ancient Practical Manual of Ayurveda. Samhita teaching and
learning process need to be practically oriented for a better understanding of the subject. It is the need
of time to make some addition in the current teaching and learning process of Samhita to make it more
relevant, practical, and contemporary. New teaching technology tools will certainly be helpful in the
effective delivery of knowledge of Samhita. As per the revised regulation, the nomenclature of the
subject is Samhita Adhyayana-I.
       The subject includes Ashtanga Hridayam Sutrasthana 1 to 15 chapters and Charaka Samhita
Sutrasthana 1 to 12 chapters as a part of Samhita Adhyayana-I for First Professional BAMS course. In
this revision, NCISM has tried its best to take Samhita teaching beyond the four walls of the classroom
and connected it with todays’ living of people and society. For effective content delivery and to create
interest in the subject of Samhita, it becomes evident to teach Samhita with practical demonstrations.
       Samhita Path is the first step and most effective method of Samhita teaching adopted and
practiced by our ancient acharyas. In order to facilitate practice the ancient Samhita learning, twice the
non-lecture class of the total classes is exclusively reserved for Samhita learning activity. To make
baseline uniformity in the process of learning, teaching methodology guidelines are provided which
shall be followed while teaching the chapters of both the Samhitas. Students learn various principles
of Ayurveda in Samhitas. Terminologies make the task initially difficult. Hence to make the Samhita
learning more interesting, various education technology tools are included in the curriculum at various
places understanding the need of the topic. Activity-based learning will enable the internalization of
the concepts and will build a strong platform while learning other subjects of Ayurved.
         As explained in Samhitas things learned in shastra(Science) and experience practically both
when happens together will enhance the knowledge. It will further lead to application in practice.
