# 🦴 Clavicle (v2)
**(Strictly According to Gray’s Anatomy for Students & Vishram Singh)**

---

## 1. Introduction & Definition
- The **clavicle** is a **long bone** placed **horizontally** at the **root of the neck**.
- It connects the **upper limb to the axial skeleton**.
- It functions as a **strut**, holding the shoulder laterally and permitting free movement of the upper limb.

> **Gray’s concept**: The clavicle is a mechanical link that transmits forces from the upper limb to the trunk.

---

## 2. Side Determination (Vishram Singh)
To determine the side of a clavicle:
- Two ends: **medial (sternal)** and **lateral (acromial)**
- **Medial end**: thick, bulky, quadrangular
- **Lateral end**: flat
- **Superior surface**: smooth
- **Inferior surface**: rough
- **Medial 2/3** of shaft: convex forwards
- **Lateral 1/3** of shaft: concave forwards

---

## 3. Parts of Clavicle
- Medial (sternal) end  
- Lateral (acromial) end  
- Shaft  

---

## 4. Medial (Sternal) End
### Description
- Large, quadrangular
- Articulates with:
  - Manubrium sterni
  - First costal cartilage

### Joint
- **Sternoclavicular joint**
- Type: **Saddle synovial joint**

### Ligament Attachments (Gray’s)
- Anterior sternoclavicular ligament
- Posterior sternoclavicular ligament
- Interclavicular ligament
- **Costoclavicular ligament** (chief stabilizer)

> This is the **only bony articulation between upper limb and trunk**.

---

## 5. Lateral (Acromial) End
### Description
- Flat from above downwards
- Articulates with **acromion process of scapula**

### Joint
- **Acromioclavicular joint**
- Type: **Plane synovial joint**

### Ligament Attachments
- Acromioclavicular ligament
- **Coracoclavicular ligament**, consisting of:
  - **Conoid ligament** (medial, vertical)
  - **Trapezoid ligament** (lateral, oblique)

> **Vishram Singh**: Coracoclavicular ligament is the **main stabilizer** of the joint.

---

## 6. Shaft of Clavicle
### Curvatures
- Medial 2/3 → convex forwards  
- Lateral 1/3 → concave forwards  

### Surfaces

#### A. Superior Surface
- Smooth
- Subcutaneous
- Covered by skin and superficial fascia

#### B. Inferior Surface (High-Yield)
- Rough
- Shows the following features:
  - **Subclavian groove** – for subclavius muscle
  - **Conoid tubercle** – for conoid ligament
  - **Trapezoid line** – for trapezoid ligament
  - **Impression for costoclavicular ligament** – near medial end

---

## 7. Muscle Attachments
### Medial Half
- Sternocleidomastoid (upper surface)
- Pectoralis major (anterior surface)

### Middle
- Subclavius (inferior surface)

### Lateral Third
- Deltoid (anterior border)
- Trapezius (posterior border)

---

## 8. Blood Supply & Nerve Supply
- **Blood supply**:
  - Suprascapular artery
  - Thoracoacromial artery
- **Nerve supply**:
  - Supraclavicular nerves (C3, C4)

---

## 9. Ossification of Clavicle
### Primary Ossification
- Two primary centers
- Appear in **5th–6th week of intrauterine life**
- Mode: **Intramembranous ossification**

### Secondary Ossification
- One secondary center at **sternal end**
- Appears at **18–20 years**
- Fusion completed by **~25 years**

> The clavicle is the **first bone to ossify and the last to fuse**.

---

## 10. Applied Anatomy
### Fracture of Clavicle
- Most common site:
  - Junction of **medial 2/3 and lateral 1/3**
- Reason:
  - Weakest point
  - Change in curvature

**Displacement:**
- Medial fragment → pulled upwards by sternocleidomastoid
- Lateral fragment → pulled downwards by weight of upper limb

---

### Acromioclavicular Dislocation
- Occurs due to rupture of **coracoclavicular ligament**
- Shoulder droops
- Clavicle becomes prominent

---

## 11. Key Gray’s Concept
> The clavicle prevents medial collapse of the shoulder and ensures efficient movement at the glenohumeral joint.

---

## 12. One-Line Examiner Answer
> *The clavicle is a horizontally placed long bone acting as a strut between the sternum and scapula, transmitting forces from the upper limb to the axial skeleton.*
