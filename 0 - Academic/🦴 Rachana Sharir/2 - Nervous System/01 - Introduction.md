## 📑 Definition
The **Nervous System** is the master controlling and communicating system of the body. It controls and coordinates all essential functions of the body through electrical impulses.

## ⚙️ Functions
1.  **Sensory Input:** Monitoring changes inside and outside the body.
2.  **Integration:** Processing and interpreting sensory input.
3.  **Motor Output:** Causing a response by activating effector organs (muscles/glands).

## 🏗️ Organization
### 1. Anatomical Organization
- **Central Nervous System (CNS):** Brain & Spinal Cord.
- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):** Cranial Nerves (12 pairs) & Spinal Nerves (31 pairs).

### 2. Functional Organization
- **Somatic Nervous System:** Voluntary control (Skeletal muscles).
- **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):** Involuntary control (Smooth muscles, cardiac muscles, glands).
    - *Sympathetic* (Fight or Flight)
    - *Parasympathetic* (Rest and Digest)
