# 🎓 Section 1: Tolerance Training (The Fuel)
> **Goal:** Nervous System Override.

> [!abstract] Core Concept
> You are not training your mind; you are training your **Nervous System** to tolerate the discomfort of rote memorization without escaping into "Meta-Work."

## 📜 The Rules
1.  **Time:** 06:00 PM - 07:00 PM (Sharp).
2.  **Task:** Raw Memorization (Sanskrit/Anatomy).
3.  **Strict Constraint:** NO organizing files. NO talking to AI. NO "optimizing."
4.  **Action:** Just pure, slow, ugly memorization.

## 📊 Binary Success
- **Yes:** You sat in the chair and did the work for 60 minutes.
- **No:** You escaped.

# ⚡ Section 2: Tesla Learning Protocol (The Engine)
> **Goal:** Deep Reconstruction.

> *"You do not study to remember. You study to reconstruct."*
> **Trigger:** Before any Academic Session.

## 🛑 Pre-Flight Checklist (Mandatory)
> *If you cannot check all, **ABORT** the study session. Switch to "Resource Gathering Mode" instead.*

- [ ] **1. The Scope:** I have defined the **exact** topics for this session. (e.g., "Vata Dosha Locations" NOT "Kriya Sharir").
- [ ] **2. The Ammo:** I have **Readymade Notes** or **Source Material** open.
    - *Rule:* **NO NOTE-MAKING ALLOWED.** You are a Consumer/Tester, not an Editor.
- [ ] **3. The Mode:** I am in **"Debug Mode"**, not "Reading Mode".
    - *Mindset:* The text is code. My brain is the compiler. I am looking for bugs in *my* simulation.

## ⚡ The Active Engine (The Tesla Loop)

### 🔄 Loop 1: The Blind Prediction (Active Recall)
*Before reading a paragraph/header:*
1.  **Look at the Header:** (e.g., "Functions of Pitta").
2.  **Close Eyes:** Visualize the mechanism. *Guess* what should be there based on logic.
3.  **The Bet:** Commit to an answer. "I bet Pitta does digestion and vision."
4.  **The Reveal:** Read the text.
    - *Hit:* Dopamine spike.
    - *Miss:* **CRITICAL MOMENT.** Ask: *"Why did my logic fail?"* -> **This is where learning happens.**

### 🔗 Loop 2: Elaborative Encoding (The Web)
*After finishing a concept:*
1.  **The "Disease" Logic:**
    - "If this [Function] fails, what [Symptom] happens?"
2.  **The "Boss" Logic (Sanskrit):**
    - "Who governs this?" (e.g., Vata moves Pitta).
3.  **The Connection:**
    - "This reminds me of [Concept X] from [Subject Y]."

### 🛠️ Loop 3: Problem-Based Learning (The Engineer)
*Don't ask "What is X?" Ask "How do I fix X?"*
- **The Prompt:** "A patient walks in with [Opposite Symptom]. Which attribute of this Dosha is broken?"

## 🚫 Hazard Warning: The Passive Trap
- **Symptom:** You are highlighting text.
- **Symptom:** You are fixing font sizes/formatting.
- **Symptom:** You are reading without pausing to predict.
- **Fix:** **STOP.** Stand up. Do 5 Squats. Reset to **Loop 1**.
