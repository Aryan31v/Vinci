# ⚔️ The Bridge Protocol: Energy Re-Assignment

> [!abstract] Core Concept
> Anxiety is **Unassigned Energy**. The "Radar" turns on when the processor is idle. The Bridge uses high-RAM tasks to hand off focus from survival to performance.

## 🛠️ The Three Steps
1.  **Detect:** Notice the "Radar" turning on or the "Statue State" beginning.
2.  **Stabilize (The Pump):** 4-4-4 Breathing (Box Breathing) for 2 minutes to oxygenate the brain and stop the shaking.
3.  **Bridge (The Hand-Off):** **Instantly** assign a high-RAM task.
    - *Math:* Multiply $13 \times 17$.
    - *Spatial:* Count all red objects in your 360 view.
    - *Linguistic:* Recite a Sanskrit rule backwards.

## 🎯 Success Metric
- **Win:** The Radar shuts down because the CPU is full.
- **Fail:** Processor remains idle; Anxiety loops return.
