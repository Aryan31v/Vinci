# 🎓 Tolerance Training: Nervous System Override

> [!abstract] Core Concept
> You are not training your mind; you are training your **Nervous System** to tolerate the discomfort of rote memorization without escaping into "Meta-Work."

## 📜 The Rules
1.  **Time:** 06:00 PM - 07:00 PM (Sharp).
2.  **Task:** Raw Memorization (Sanskrit/Anatomy).
3.  **Strict Constraint:** NO organizing files. NO talking to AI. NO "optimizing."
4.  **Action:** Just pure, slow, ugly memorization.

## 📊 Binary Success
- **Yes:** You sat in the chair and did the work for 60 minutes.
- **No:** You escaped.
