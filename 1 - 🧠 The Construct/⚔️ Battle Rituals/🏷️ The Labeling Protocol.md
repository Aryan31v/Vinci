# 🏷️ The Labeling Protocol (Touch & Go)
> "The goal of labeling is Dis-identification, not Taxonomy."

## 🚨 The Friction Point
**The Trap:** You are getting stuck asking, *"Is this a plan? A memory? A fantasy? Did I label it correctly?"*
**The Result:** You turn Meditation into Thinking. You are **Thinking about Thinking**.

## 🛠️ The Protocol: 3-Bucket System
Stop trying to be accurate. The subconscious knows what the thought is; the label is just a "tag" to drop it. Use only these **3 Generic Labels**:

### 1. 💭 "Thinking"
*   **Use for:** *Anything* mental.
*   *Examples:* Planning dinner, remembering a betrayal, imagining a chess game, worrying about exams.
*   *Don't use:* "Planning," "Regretting," "Visualizing." **Just say "Thinking."**

### 2. 🌊 "Feeling"
*   **Use for:** *Anything* physical or emotional sensation.
*   *Examples:* Itch on nose, knee pain, anger in chest, anxiety shaking, "floating" sensation.
*   *Don't use:* "Itching," "Hurting," "Anxiety." **Just say "Feeling."**

### 3. 👂 "Hearing"
*   **Use for:** *Anything* external.
*   *Examples:* Construction noise, bird chirping, fan whirring.
*   *Don't use:* "Bird," "Hammer," "Noise." **Just say "Hearing."**

## ⚡ The "Feather" Technique
**Concept:** Imagine your attention is a **Feather**, not a pair of pliers.
1.  **Notice:** You realize you are distracted.
2.  **Touch:** Lightly touch the thought with the label ("Thinking").
3.  **Go:** Immediately return to the breath/mantra.
    *   *Do NOT* check if the thought is gone.
    *   *Do NOT* check if you labeled it right.
    *   *Do NOT* push it away.

**The Golden Rule:** A "wrong" label applied quickly is better than a "right" label applied slowly. Speed > Accuracy.
