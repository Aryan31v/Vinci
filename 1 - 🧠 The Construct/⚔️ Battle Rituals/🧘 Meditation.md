# 🧘 Meditation Guide

## 1. The Posture
*   **Sit:** Cross-legged (*Sukhasana*). Spine perfectly straight (like a stack of coins). Hands on knees (Palms up or *Gyan Mudra*).
*   **Eyes:** Closed.
*   **Focus:** Bring your entire attention to the spot between your eyebrows (**Third Eye** / *Ajna Chakra*).

## 2. The Internal Sound
You are not moving your tongue or lips. The sound is happening *inside* your skull.
*   **Method A (Breath Sync):**
    *   **Inhale:** Silently hear *"Om"*.
    *   **Exhale:** Silently hear *"Namah Shivaya"*.
*   **Method B (Rhythmic Loop):**
    *   Repeat *Om Namah Shivaya* in a steady, rhythmic loop, independent of breath.

## 3. The "Tap" Visualization (Crucial)
This is the "secret sauce" for focus.
*   **Origin:** Imagine the sound of the mantra is not coming from your throat, but **originating directly from the Third Eye**.
*   **The Feeling:** With every "Om" or every full mantra, feel a tiny, subtle **magnetic pulse** or **tap** at that spot between your eyebrows.
*   **Analogy:** Imagine a drop of water falling onto a still lake at that exact spot. *Drip (Om)... Drip (Namah Shivaya)...*

## 4. Sensations & Signs
*   **Pressure:** A heaviness or "thumb-press" sensation between the eyebrows. This indicates energy gathering.
*   **Heat:** Sudden warmth in the spine or forehead.
*   **The Void:** After 20-30 repetitions, thoughts may slow down, creating a sensation of floating in dark, empty space.
*   **Resistance:** The mind may generate boredom or physical discomfort ("My leg hurts"). **Ignore it.** Return to the "Tap."
