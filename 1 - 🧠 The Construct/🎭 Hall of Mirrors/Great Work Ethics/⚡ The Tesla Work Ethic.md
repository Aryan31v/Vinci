# 🌪️ Section 1: The 5 Pillars of Tesla's Workflow (Theory)
> **Source:** [[1 - 🧠 The Construct/🤖 AI Core/00 - Mental Models Compendium|Mental Models Compendium]]

### 1. Problem-Centric Learning (Not Syllabus-Centric)
- **The Mechanism:** Instead of following a linear syllabus, Tesla organized his intellectual growth around specific, "stubborn" mechanical and causal problems.
- **Application:** Don't study "Anatomy." Study "How does the arm move without breaking?"

### 2. The Internal Simulator (Mental Lab)
- **The Mechanism:** Tesla claimed he could build, test, and even run internal mental simulations of his inventions for weeks until every "part" was balanced. He didn't build physical prototypes until the mental one was perfect.
- **Application:** Before checking an answer, visualize the mechanism. If you can't see it moving, you don't know it.

### 3. Cognitive Stamina (The Hold)
- **The Mechanism:** Resisting the urge to "escape" confusion by switching topics. Tesla would hold a single question in his mind for months.
- **Application:** When you feel "stuck," stay there for 5 more minutes. That is where the neuroplasticity happens.

### 4. Precision over Speed
- **The Mechanism:** Tesla didn't care for credentials or immediate results; he cared for **Long-term Correctness**.
- **Application:** It is better to learn 1 page perfectly than 10 pages vaguely.

### 5. Elaborative Encoding (Recall)
- **The Mechanism:** After reading, Tesla would close the book and write down the core mechanisms, arguments, and implications from memory.
- **Application:** Close the book. Write it down. If you can't, you didn't read it.

# ⚡ Section 2: The Tesla Learning Protocol (Implementation)
> **Goal:** Deep Reconstruction.
> **Context:** Originally from `⚔️ Protocol Learning Mastery`.

> *"You do not study to remember. You study to reconstruct."*
> **Trigger:** Before any Academic Session.

## 🛑 Pre-Flight Checklist
> *If you cannot check all, **ABORT** the study session. Switch to "Resource Gathering Mode" instead.*

- [ ] **1. The Scope:** I have defined the **exact** topics for this session. (e.g., "Vata Dosha Locations" NOT "Kriya Sharir").
- [ ] **2. The Ammo:** I have **Readymade Notes** or **Source Material** open.
    - *Rule:* **NO NOTE-MAKING ALLOWED.** You are a Consumer/Tester, not an Editor.
- [ ] **3. The Mode:** I am in **"Debug Mode"**, not "Reading Mode".
    - *Mindset:* The text is code. My brain is the compiler. I am looking for bugs in *my* simulation.

## ⚡ The Active Engine (The Tesla Loop)

### 🔄 Loop 1: The Blind Prediction (Active Recall)
*Before reading a paragraph/header:*
1.  **Look at the Header:** (e.g., "Functions of Pitta").
2.  **Close Eyes:** Visualize the mechanism. *Guess* what should be there based on logic.
3.  **The Bet:** Commit to an answer. "I bet Pitta does digestion and vision."
4.  **The Reveal:** Read the text.
    - *Hit:* Dopamine spike.
    - *Miss:* **CRITICAL MOMENT.** Ask: *"Why did my logic fail?"* -> **This is where learning happens.**

### 🔗 Loop 2: Elaborative Encoding (The Web)
*After finishing a concept:*
1.  **The "Disease" Logic:**
    - "If this [Function] fails, what [Symptom] happens?"
2.  **The "Boss" Logic (Sanskrit):**
    - "Who governs this?" (e.g., Vata moves Pitta).
3.  **The Connection:**
    - "This reminds me of [Concept X] from [Subject Y]."

### 🛠️ Loop 3: Problem-Based Learning (The Engineer)
*Don't ask "What is X?" Ask "How do I fix X?"*
- **The Prompt:** "A patient walks in with [Opposite Symptom]. Which attribute of this Dosha is broken?"

---

# ⚠️ Section 3: The Shadow Side (Warning)
- **Isolation:** Tesla died alone. His obsession alienated him from humanity.
- **Burnout:** Sustained cognitive engagement without recovery leads to the collapses Tesla experienced later in life.
- **The Fix:** Use the **Social Simulator** and **Meditation** to ground yourself. Do not become the machine.
