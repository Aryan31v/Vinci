# 🌌 The Physics Map: The Source Code

> [!abstract] Objective
> To deconstruct the universe from **First Principles**. We are not here to calculate; we are here to understand the **Why**.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: The Stage (Relativity & Spacetime)
- [x] **1.1 Why Time?** The relationship between change, entropy, and the "Arrow."
- [x] **1.2 The Speed Limit:** Why can't anything go faster than light? (The $c$ constant).
- [x] **1.3 Time Dilation:** Why does time "stretch"? (Answering your gap).
- [x] **1.4 Gravity as Geometry:** Why mass bends the "fabric" of reality.

## 🕳️ Phase 2: The Extremes (Cosmology)
- [x] **2.1 Black Holes:** The point where the Source Code breaks.
- [x] **2.2 White Holes:** The mathematical mirror.
- [x] **2.3 Planets & Orbits:** The dance of momentum and curves.

## ⚛️ Phase 3: The Ghost in the Machine (Quantum)
- [x] **3.1 Wave-Particle Duality:** The universe as a probability.
- [x] **3.2 Entanglement:** The "Prana" of the Quantum world?
- [x] **3.3 The Observer Effect:** The intersection of Physics and Consciousness.
