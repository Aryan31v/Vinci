# 🧬 Bio-Physics Map: Engineering the Self

> [!abstract] Mission
> To treat the Human Body not as a "Temple," but as a **High-Performance Machine**.
> **Goal:** The "Iron Man" Protocol. First, engineer the pilot (Bio-Physics). Then, engineer the suit (Tech/Math).

## ⚡ Module 1: The Circuit (Nervous System)
*Physics Concept: Electricity & Resistance (Ohm's Law).*
- [ ] **1.1 The Battery:** How "Resting Potential" stores energy in your nerves.
- [ ] **1.2 The Signal:** Action Potentials as binary code (0s and 1s).
- [ ] **1.3 Resistance:** Why "Anxiety" is just electrical noise/friction.
- [ ] **1.4 Rewiring:** Neuroplasticity as circuit redesign.

## 🌡️ Module 2: The Engine (Metabolism)
*Physics Concept: Thermodynamics & Energy ($E=mc^2$ applied).*
- [ ] **2.1 The Fuel:** ATP as the universal battery.
- [ ] **2.2 Efficiency:** Why your brain burns 20% of your energy (The CPU cost).
- [ ] **2.3 Entropy:** Why "Tiredness" is inevitable (Waste Heat).
- [ ] **2.4 Cooling Systems:** Breath (Pranayama) as a radiator.

## 🏗️ Module 3: The Frame (Biomechanics)
*Physics Concept: Levers, Torque, & Tension.*
- [ ] **3.1 Levers:** Your bones are machines.
- [ ] **3.2 Tension:** Fascia as a "Tensegrity" structure (Spiderman's Web).
- [ ] **3.3 Gravity:** How to use the Earth to move lighter.

## 🔮 The Bridge to "Iron Man"
Once you understand the **Bio-Machine**, we will graduate to **Hardware**.
- **Bio-Physics:** "I understand how my hand moves."
- **Tech-Physics:** "I can build a robotic hand that moves the same way."

**Scholar's Note:** This IS Physics. It is **Applied Physics**.
Biology is just Physics that learned to replicate.
