## 🧠 Core Friction: The 2D/3D Gap
> "I played dumb / I confused the Queen and King."

**The Phenomenon:**
The user experiences a "Contextual Blindness" when switching from Digital (2D/Top-Down) to Physical (3D/Isometric).
- **The Anchor:** In 2D, the board is always oriented "White at Bottom." In 3D, playing Black reverses the spatial geometry.
- **The Glitch:** The brain keeps the "White Perspective" map overlaying the "Black Perspective" reality.
- **Result:** **Spatial Hallucination.** (Attempting to castle a Queen because it sits where the King "should" be).

## ⚔️ The Recurring Demon (The Opponent)
- **Pattern:** Losing to the same opponent from the previous year.
- **Psychology:** The opponent represents a "Static Failure Point." The loss isn't just a game; it's a validation of "I haven't changed."
- **Win Condition:** The victory is not Checkmate; it is **Remaining Lucid** during the match.

## 🧱 Constraints & Style
- **Opening:** Fixed ("First 6-7 moves always same").
- **Notation:** No PGNs available. Analysis relies on "Descriptive Recounting" (e.g., "Horse to f3").
- **Vocabulary:**
    - "Corner Piece" = Rook 🏰
    - "Horse" = Knight 🐎
    - "Warrior" = Pawn ♟️
    - "Exchange" = Castling 🔄

## 🚦 Strategic Interventions
### 1. The Calibration Ritual (Draft)
*To be tested in next OTB match.*
1.  **Touch the King:** Break the digital trance.
2.  **State the Color:** "I am Black. Queen is on Black."
3.  **Scan the Diagonals:** Reset depth perception.
