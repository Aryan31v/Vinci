## 🗺️ Framework Overview
The video outlines five strategic ways professionals can move beyond generic AI prompts to achieve high-quality, actionable results in a work environment.

### 1. Context Cheating (The "Lazy" Pro Trick) 🧠
- **Problem:** AI output is only as good as the context, but writing detailed context is time-consuming.
- **Solution:** Instead of explaining a framework (like SCQA or PAS) to the AI, search for a high-quality explanation on Google, copy it, and paste it directly into the prompt.
- **Application:**
    - **Writing Style:** "Write in the voice of Lee Child." (Copy-paste a description of his style: short sentences, punchy verbs).
    - **Consulting Frameworks:** "Structure this presentation using the **SCQA Framework**." (Copy-paste the definition: *Situation, Complication, Question, Answer* from a top consulting blog).

### 2. Convert with Intention (Strategic Summarization) 🎯
- **Problem:** Generic summaries of dense PDFs are often unusable.
- **Solution:** Give the AI a **clear business objective** for the summary.
- **Example Case:**
    - **Input:** A 128-page McKinsey report on the "State of Fashion."
    - **Bad Prompt:** "Summarize this report."
    - **Strategic Prompt:** "Prepare a business plan for traditional fast fashion companies like **Zara** to compete against rapidly growing new entrants like **Shein** and **Temu**. Use the attached report."
- **Outcome:** Generates structured outlines with headers and bullet points aligned with a specific hypothesis, rather than a generic abstract.

### 3. Answer Leveling (Breaking Inconsistency) 📈
- **Problem:** AI ideas fluctuate between brilliant and basic.
- **Solution:** Force the AI to categorize its own output by quality/complexity levels.
- **Protocol (Study Strategy Example):**
    1.  **Level 1 (Passive/Standard):** "Read the textbook chapter and highlight key terms."
    2.  **Level 2 (Active):** "Create flashcards (Anki) for the definitions and take a practice quiz."
    3.  **Level 3 (Meta-Cognitive/Deep):** "Use the **Feynman Technique**: Explain the concept to a 5-year-old. Identify exactly where I get stuck, then re-read *only* that part. Finally, build a **Memory Palace** for the key list."
- **Sweet Spot:** Level 3 is often where the most usable yet innovative ideas reside. It pushes the AI past the "obvious" first token predictions.

### 4. Seamless Data Extraction 📊
- **Problem:** Manual data entry from career sites or lists is tedious.
- **Solution:** Select all text (`Ctrl+A`) from a webpage, paste it into the AI, and command it to populate a table.
- **Example Case:**
    - **Source:** Google Careers Page (filtered for specific roles/locations).
    - **Prompt:** "Create a table with columns: Role, Location, Team, and 'Key Requirements' (extract 3 keywords). Leave 'Application Link' blank."
- **Export:** The resulting table can be converted to CSV and imported into Notion, Excel, or Google Sheets for tracking.

### 5. Actionable Insights & The 80/20 Rule ⚖️
- **Problem:** Data analysis without a path forward.
- **Solution:** Use the **Pareto Principle** (80/20 Rule) to focus the AI on the most impactful actions.
- **Example Case:**
    - **Scenario:** A paid wallpaper app is receiving negative feedback.
    - **Prompt:** "Analyze this feedback. Apply the **80/20 Rule** to identify the 20% of issues causing 80% of the dissatisfaction. Recommend 3 detailed action items."
    - **Result:** Instead of fixing every bug, the AI identifies that "Paid users want to vote on upcoming packs" is the highest-leverage feature to build.

## 🔬 Scholar's Synthesis
- **Meta-Pattern:** The common thread across all use cases is **Prompt Engineering via Framework Injection**. By providing external structures (Google results, specific objectives, or levels), the user bypasses the AI's tendency toward "average" responses.
- **Tool Selection:** Gemini is noted to be superior for URL/Web-page context processing compared to ChatGPT.
