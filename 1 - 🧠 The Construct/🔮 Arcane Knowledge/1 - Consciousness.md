## 📜 The Ancient Manual: Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras (Chapter 3)

The most authoritative "how-to" manual for this is the *Yoga Sutras of Patanjali*, specifically the third chapter, known as the *Vibhuti Pada* (The Chapter on Powers).

### The Formula: Samyama
Patanjali describes a specific mental technology called **Samyama**. This is the simultaneous practice of three stages of focus:
1.  **Dharana (Concentration):** Fixing the mind on a single object (like a candle flame, a deity, or a concept).
2.  **Dhyana (Meditation):** The flow of attention becomes unbroken, like oil pouring from a jug.
3.  **Samadhi (Absorption):** The observer disappears. You become so merged with the object that only the object exists in your awareness.

### Mechanism of Action
Patanjali states that if you perform Samyama on a specific object, you gain intimate knowledge of it.

> *"By samyama on the light within, one gains knowledge of the subtle, the hidden, and the remote."* — Sutra 3.26

**The Pratyahara Gateway**
*Pratyahara* (sense withdrawal) is crucial. When external perception shuts down, internal perception activates.

## 🔬 Scientific & Psychological Perspectives

### The "Antenna" Theory
- **Meditation:** Advanced meditation shuts down physical senses (Pratyahara). The brain switches frequency.
- **Range:** The Sadhu in the video mentioned seeing for "200 km," implying a signal-to-noise ratio limitation based on mental quietness.

### Key Sources
1.  **"Real Magic" (Dean Radin, PhD):** Explains quantum entanglement as the mechanism for "reading through walls."
2.  **"Penetration" (Ingo Swann):** Training protocols for US Intelligence (Remote Viewing).
3.  **The Visuddhimagga:** Buddhist manual giving specific visualization instructions for element control.

## 🧮 The Math of Attainment

### The "12-Second" Formula
Development of power is directly related to **unbroken focus duration**.

| Stage | Duration | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dharana** | 12 Seconds | Unbroken concentration. |
| **Dhyana** | 144 Seconds | 12 x 12 seconds. |
| **Samadhi** | ~29 Minutes | 12 x 12 x 12 seconds. |

> [!tip] The Threshold
> To hold the mind absolutely still for **30 minutes** typically takes **3 to 5 years** of practicing 2 hours daily.

### The "Mandala" Formula (Tantric)
- **Cycle:** 40-48 days (One Mandala).
- **Intensity:** 4 hours/day (usually pre-sunrise).
- **Result:** "Glimpses" after one Mandala. Permanent control requires ~12 years.

### The Brutal Math (10,000 Hours)
To reach the "Sadhu Level" (Mastery):

| Daily Practice | Years to Mastery (10k Hours) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **2 Hours** | 13.7 Years |
| **4 Hours** | 6.8 Years |
| **8 Hours** | 3.4 Years |
