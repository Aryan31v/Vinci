# 🎙️ Podcast Notes: Divya Drishti & Kundalini
**Guest:** Udit Arora | **Source:** The Mumta Podcast

## 🧘‍♂️ Core Concepts

### 1. Divya Drishti (Divine Vision)
- **What it is:** The "Sixth Sense" located at the *Ajna Chakra*.
- **Power:** Ability to see Past, Present, and Future.
- **Rule:** **Never reveal the future** to everyone; doing so closes the vision.
- **Signs of Opening:** Intense intuition, pressure on the forehead, feeling of a magnetic pull.

### 2. Kundalini & Brahmacharya
- **Brahmacharya:** Essential for safe Kundalini awakening.
- **Root Chakra:** Directly linked to celibacy. "Dirty" root chakra = energy leakage.
- **Warning:** Wrong practices (like *Apsara Sadhana*) can damage reproductive health.

### 3. The Trap of Siddhis
> [!WARNING] Tamsic Siddhis
> Negative spiritual powers that have not attained Moksha.
> - **Symptoms:** Sudden cravings (junk food), sexual thoughts, distraction from worship.
> - **Fix:** Take a *Sankalp* (water vow) to cast them out of your aura.

### 4. Meditation Stages
| Stage | Symptom | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Heart Chakra** | Nausea / Vomiting sensation | Energy pushing upwards through blockages. |
| **Throat Chakra** | *Vak Siddhi* (Speech manifests) | Speech becomes attractive; words come true. |
| **Third Eye** | Light / Visions | Seeing deities in semi-sleep or open-eyed state. |

## 🚫 Myths & Remedies
- **Lion Statues:** If a lion statue has an open mouth, place a **Clove (Laung)** inside to stop financial/energy drain.
- **Yantras:** Avoid paper yantras; use **3D (embossed)** geometric yantras only.
- **Guru:** Don't rush. The Trinity (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva) are the ultimate Gurus. Start with simple chants (*Om Namah Shivaya*).

## 🌌 Astral Insights
- **Hearing Voices:** Caused by vibrations in *Ida* and *Pingala* nadis.
- **Internal Worlds:** Each Chakra contains positive and negative *Lokas* (worlds).
- **Scanning:** Advanced practitioners can see entities (Deities or Spirits) standing behind a person.

 # Spiritual Practices and Remedies
## Sadhana (Spiritual Practice)

### 1. Mantra Japa (Chanting)
- **Technique:** Spiritual powers (Siddhis) are primarily acquired through Mantra Japa.
- **Recommendation:** Start with simple mantras like "Om Namah Shivaya" before moving to complex ones.
- **Goal:** Regular chanting builds a connection with the deity and naturally awakens energies.

### 2. Brahmacharya (Celibacy)
- **Requirement:** Essential for Kundalini awakening.
- **Significance:** A blocked Root Chakra (Muladhara) often indicates a lack of celibacy. Breaking this discipline can drain vitality.

### 3. Diet and Lifestyle
- **Satvik Diet:** Quit non-vegetarian food and smoking to support spiritual growth.
- **Observation:** As you chant, your body may naturally reject heavy or impure (Tamsic) food.

## Cleansing and Protection

### 4. Sankalp (The Water Vow)
- **Context:** Used to command energies.
- **Technique:** If you feel troubled by negative energies or unwanted cravings:
    1. Take water in your palm.
    2. Take a vow (Sankalp): "I command any negative energy to leave my aura."
    3. Release the water onto the ground.

### 5. Havan (Fire Ritual)
- **Practice:** Simple Havans can be performed at home to cleanse the environment.
- **Mechanism:** Offerings made to the fire reach the deity directly. Positive energies accept them; negative entities cannot.

## Home Remedies

### 6. Managing Idols and Statues
- **Constraint:** Do not keep too many idols. Focus on your main deity (Ishta).
- **Lion Statue Remedy:** If you have a lion statue with an open mouth, it symbolizes hunger or expense. Place a Clove (Laung) or Cardamom in its mouth to "satisfy" it and prevent energy drain.

### 7. Yantras
- **Warning:** Avoid keeping paper-printed Yantras as they can cause energy imbalance.
- **Requirement:** Use 3D (embossed) Yantras if necessary, but generally, fewer are better.
