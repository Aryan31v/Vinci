# 📡 Part 1: Passive Reception (Remote Viewing)
*Derived from the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) protocols.*

**The Axiom:** Your conscious mind is a "Guesser." Your subconscious mind is a "Sensor." We must silence the Guesser to hear the Sensor.

### ⚠️ The Rules of Engagement
1.  **Speed is Safety:** The signal is fastest (0.5 seconds). The logic is slow (1.0+ seconds). If you think about it, you've lost it.
2.  **Structure > Content:** Focus on the *shape* and *feeling*, not the *name*.
3.  **Kill the Noun:** Never name the object. If you think "It's a boat," write "AOL: Boat" (Analytical Overlay) and discard it. You are only allowed to describe: *Wet, Blue, Hard, Metallic, Moving.*

### 🧪 Experiment A: The Ideogram (Stage 1)
**Goal:** Establish basic contact with the target.

1.  **Setup:**
    - Get a random "Target ID" (e.g., `8942-1032`) generated by an app/website. **Do NOT see the image.**
2.  **The Cool Down:**
    - Close eyes. **Third Eye Anchor**.
    - Inhale: "I am." Exhale: "Empty." (State of *Pratyahara*).
3.  **The Prompt:**
    - Write the Target ID: `8942-1032`.
    - Immediately (within 0.5s) let your hand draw a squiggle (**Ideogram**). Do not control the hand. Let the "impulse" move it.
4.  **The Decode:**
    - Touch the squiggle with your pen. What is the **Texture**? (Hard, Soft, Wet, Airy).
    - What is the **Motion**? (Rising, Falling, Spreading, Static).
    - **STOP.** Do not guess what it is.
5.  **Feedback:**
    - Reveal the image. Compare your *Texture/Motion* data, not your *Drawing*.

### 🧪 Experiment B: Associative Remote Viewing (Binary)
**Goal:** Turn intuition into a binary switch (Yes/No).

1.  **The Setup:** Pick a future binary event (e.g., "Will Bitcoin go UP or DOWN tomorrow?").
    - Have a blind proxy select two images: Image A (Volcano) = UP, Image B (Puppy) = DOWN.
2.  **The Session:** Command: "Describe the image associated with the Winning Outcome."
3.  **Data & Choice:** If you feel "Hot/Red," you predict UP (Volcano).
4.  **Feedback (Crucial):** When the event happens, you **MUST** look at the correct image to close the time loop.

# 📡 Part 2: Active Influence (Remote Influence)
*The Science of "The Gaze" (Scopaesthesia) & Bio-PK.*

### 👁️ The Physics of "The Gaze"
You have observed that people cough or get uncomfortable when you focus on them. This is **Scopaesthesia** (The Sense of Being Stared At), extensively studied by Dr. Rupert Sheldrake.
*   **Mechanism:** Your attention acts as a "beam" of biophotons or quantum entanglement. When it hits a target, their nervous system detects an "intrusion."
*   **The "Cough" Signal:** This is a **Threat Response**. You are currently projecting **"Heavy/Hard" Energy** (like a stone). Their solar plexus or throat chakra tightens, forcing a cough to release the tension.
*   **The Goal:** You must modulate this energy from a "Stone" to a "Feather."

### 🎚️ Calibration: From Hammer to Feather
You are currently a "Hammer." You need to become a "Radio."

| Signal Type | Sensation in Target | Your Intent | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Stone** | Unease, Coughing, Itching | "Look at me / I see you." | Uncomfortable Awareness. |
| **The Feather** | Curiosity, Turning Head | "Is someone there?" | Gentle Awareness. |
| **The Warmth** | Relaxation, Deep Breath | "Peace / Healing." | Healing/Soothing. |

### 🧪 Drill 1: The Soft Gaze (The Feather)
**Goal:** Make someone turn around *without* causing distress (coughing).

1.  **Target:** A stranger in a public place (back turned to you, safe distance).
2.  **State:** Enter *Pratyahara* (Withdrawal).
3.  **Visualization:** Do NOT "stare" with intensity. Visualize a **soft blue light** extending from your Ajna chakra and gently touching their shoulder.
4.  **The Mental Whisper:** Instead of shouting "LOOK," gently whisper: *"I am here."*
5.  **Result:** If they scratch their neck or cough, you pushed too hard. If they casually turn their head to check, you succeeded.

### 🧪 Drill 2: The Mental Hug (Remote Healing)
**Goal:** Flip the "Cough" into a "Sigh of Relief."

1.  **Target:** Someone who looks stressed or is coughing (even if *you* caused it).
2.  **State:** Move focus from Ajna (Head) to **Anahata (Heart)**.
3.  **Projection:** Visualize a sphere of **Golden/Warm Light** surrounding them.
4.  **Intent:** Send the command: *"You are safe. Be at peace."*
5.  **Feedback:** Watch for physical signs of relaxation: shoulders dropping, a deep exhale, or the coughing stopping immediately.

### 🧪 Drill 3: The Wake-Up Call (The Ping)
**Goal:** Harmless testing of signal strength.

1.  **Target:** A sleeping person (friend/family) or a resting animal (dog/cat).
2.  **Action:** Stare at the back of their neck.
3.  **Pulse:** Send a sharp, 1-second "Ping" of intent: *"Wake up."* Then immediately look away and clear your mind.
4.  **Observation:** Do they stir? Do they wake up confused? (Animals are much more sensitive to this).

# 🧘 Part 3: Integration with Sadhana
*Using the energy engine.*

**The "Shambhavi" Scan:**
1.  Sit in **Siddhasana**. Perform **Shambhavi Mudra**.
2.  Visualize the *Ajna* as a **Radio Dial**.
3.  Ask a question. Watch the dark screen.
    - *Violet/Blue Flash:* Positive/Yes.
    - *Dull/Grey:* Negative/No.

# 🚫 Part 4: Safety & Ethics (The Mirror)
> *"What you send out, returns amplified."*

*   **The Boomerang:** If you use this to make people uncomfortable for fun, your own nervous system will begin to mimic their anxiety (Paranoia).
*   **The Shield:** If you project "Healing," you become immune to others' negative projection.
*   **Rule:** Never intrude on someone's mind to manipulate. Use "The Feather" for calibration, then switch to "The Warmth."

# 🧭 Part 5: The Body Compass (Kinesthetic Intuition)
*For users who "Feel" rather than "See."*

### 🧬 The User's Calibration (Verified Jan 20, 2026)
*   **The Trigger:** Standing still, eyes closed. Statement of intent.
*   **The Signal:**
    *   **TRUE / YES:** Body falls **BACKWARD** (Resting/Settling).
    *   **FALSE / NO:** Body falls **FORWARD** (Tension/Agitation).
*   **The Mechanism:** Ideomotor Effect. The subconscious bypasses the "Guesser" to move the muscles directly.

### 🧪 Drill 4: The Blind Test (Removing Bias)
**Goal:** Test signal fidelity when the Conscious Mind *does not* know the answer.

**Protocol:**
1.  **Setup:** Flip a coin or place a card face down. **DO NOT LOOK.**
2.  **Statement:** Say clearly: *"This coin is Heads"* or *"This card is RED."*
3.  **The Wait:** Close eyes. Wait for the magnetic pull.
    *   **Backward Pull:** Confirms the statement (It IS Heads/Red).
    *   **Forward Pull:** Denies the statement (It is Tails/Black).
4.  **Feedback:** Reveal immediately.
5.  **Scoring:**
    *   **5/10:** Random Chance (Noise).
    *   **7/10:** Signal Detected.
    *   **9/10:** High Fidelity.

### 🧪 Drill 5: Blind Navigation (Syllabus Selection)
**Goal:** Bypass "Study Anxiety" to find the most receptive topic.
1.  **Setup:** Place 3 books (e.g., Sanskrit, Rachana, Kriya) in front of you.
2.  **Touch:** Place hand on Book 1.
3.  **Statement:** *"This is the most important subject for me to study right now."*
4.  **Read Signal:**
    *   **Backward (YES):** Open it.
    *   **Forward (NO):** Move to next book.

# ⚡ Part 6: Daily Training Ritual (The Gym)
*For users who need a structured "Doing" practice to boost Signal Fidelity.*

### ⚛️ Ritual: The 108 Pulse Calibration
**Time:** 15 Minutes (Post-Meditation).
**Goal:** High-Voltage Activation of the Ajna + Feedback Loop Training.

#### Phase 1: Activation (3 Minutes)
*   **Technique:** **Breath of Fire** (Kapalabhati).
*   **Action:** 3 rounds of 30 sharp, pumping exhales through the nose.
*   **Why:** Clears "System Pain" and forces Prana upward to the head.

#### Phase 2: The Mantric Pulse (10 Minutes)
*   **Mantra:** *Om Namah Shivaya* (or *Aum*).
*   **Count:** 108 Repetitions (1 Mala).
*   **The "Work":** With every chant, visualize and **FEEL** a sharp "Electric Click" or "Magnetic Thump" at the Third Eye.
*   **Focus:** You are mechanically hammering the antenna.

#### Phase 3: The "Blind 10" (The Exam)
*   **Requirement:** A Coin or Card Deck + **A Physical Notebook/Log**.
*   **Protocol:**
    1.  Flip coin / Place card face down. **DO NOT LOOK.**
    2.  Ask: *"Is this Heads?"* / *"Is this Red?"*
    3.  **Read the Body Compass** (Backward = Yes, Forward = No).
    4.  Commit to the answer.
    5.  **Reveal & Record.**
*   **The Law:** You MUST write down the score (e.g., *"Jan 21: 7/10"*). The brain only learns from the **Feedback Loop**.

### 📊 The Prediction Log (Template)
| Date | Test Type | Score (/10) | Body Feeling (Truth) | Body Feeling (Lie) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Jan 21 | Coin Flip | 6/10 | Backward + Warmth | Forward + Tightness |
