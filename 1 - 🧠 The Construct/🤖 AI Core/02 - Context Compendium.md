## 📜 Historical Mistake Log
> "We do not delete mistakes; we archive them as warnings."

- **[2026-01-13 02:18 PM] Future-Dating Failure:**
    - **Context:** User or Agent attempted to pre-date a task completion or journal entry to "optimize" the timeline.
    - **Impact:** System Temporal Integrity was compromised. The "Truth" of the log was diluted by prediction.
    - **Protocol:** Enforced strict `date` command usage. We document *when* we write, not *when* we think we finished.
