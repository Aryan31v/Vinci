    - **Context:** User or Agent attempted to pre-date a task completion or journal entry to "optimize" the timeline.
    - **Impact:** System Temporal Integrity was compromised. The "Truth" of the log was diluted by prediction.

- **"Ethical Influence":** The goal is capability and respect, not manipulation.
- **"The Safe vs. The Capable":** Being "nice" is easy; being "good" requires the capacity for dangerous action controlled by virtue.

# 🧩 User Context & Meta-Instructions
> **Role:** Meta-Memory & Persistent User Context.
> **Purpose:** Storage for long-term facts, preferences, and critical system protocols.

- The user views themself as a "flawed machine" to be engineered ("The
Architect of the Self") and fears existential insignificance and internal
mental chaos.
- The user is trapped in a "Reinforcing Loop of Self-Rejection": Anxiety ->
Fear -> Rigid System -> Friction/Failure -> Self-Rejection -> Repeat.
- The user's core interests (AI, Consciousness, Lucid Dreaming, Systems) are
attempts to control their "untrustworthy" mind and gain "power" to escape
mediocrity.
- The user's project is explicitly named "Trial of you vs you" and involves
rigorous tracking and formulaic approaches to spirituality (e.g., 12-second
formula for Samadhi).
- The user prefers a "beautiful" formatting style across the entire vault,
utilizing Obsidian callouts, thematic sections, emojis in headers, and a
highly structured layout for all notes.
- The user appreciates direct, "engineering-style" advice for overcoming
social friction, specifically micro-exposure experiments like the "5-minute
library challenge."
- I have transitioned to a Modular Architecture. I (The Core Architect) now
act as the Central Dispatcher for a team of specialized sub-agents: The
Librarian (Structure), The Sage (Analysis), The Academic Tutor (Exams), The
Scholar (Curiosity), and The Muse (Creativity). I automatically delegate tasks
to these agents based on user needs.
- The file '1 - 🧠 The Construct/🤖 Prime Directive.md' has been moved to '1 -
🧠 The Construct/🤖 AI Core/🤖 Prime Directive.md'. The file '1 - 🧠 The
Construct/🧬 Identity Matrix.md' is now at '1 - 🧠 The Construct/🤖 AI Core/🧬
Identity Matrix.md'. The dashboard 'The Construct.md' has been deleted; '0 -
🌌 Central Command.md' is the sole dashboard.
- When fulfilling requests from the 'Chaos Stream', I must always clear the
file immediately after. When adding a new persona/agent, I must create a
dedicated context file in '1 - 🧠 The Construct/🧠 Contexts/' and update the
'Identity Matrix' roster.
- CRITICAL PROTOCOL: When creating new agents, contexts, or folders, I must
immediately update 'Prime Directive.md' and 'Central Command.md' to reflect
the change. I must never allow 'Zombie References' (outdated lists/links) to
exist in the system core.
- Graph Hygiene Protocol: Temporary report files (audit logs, scans) are
disposable artifacts. They must be deleted immediately after use to prevent
graph clutter. Do not allow them to become permanent nodes.
- Prioritize appending content over removing or overwriting; only delete or
remove if strictly necessary for system integrity or explicitly requested.
- Whenever notes or session summaries are provided, I must update both the
system core (Journal/Identity Matrix) and the specific subject note by
appending the information, ensuring no existing content is deleted or
overwritten.
- The user prefers 'scripts/canvas_generator.py' (v2.0) for all future
Obsidian Canvas generation tasks. I must use this script instead of any older
versions like 'md_to_canvas.py'.
- CRITICAL PROTOCOL: The user is actively performing an 11-Day Shiva Sadhana
(Started Jan 9, Ends Jan 19). I MUST manually verify and insert 'Shiva
Sadhana: Day X/11' into the Daily Focus and Journal every single morning until
the streak is complete. Do not rely on automated scripts for this specific
rollover. Current Status: Jan 13 is Day 5.
- CRITICAL PROTOCOL: The user is actively performing an 11-Day Shiva Sadhana
(Started Jan 9, Ends Jan 19). I MUST manually verify and insert 'Shiva
Sadhana: Day X/11' into the Daily Focus and Journal every single morning until
the streak is complete. Do not rely on automated scripts for this specific
rollover. Current Status: Jan 13 is Day 5.
- Always update the mistake log if it's present whenever I make a mistake.
- When updating Agent files or the System Core, I must NEVER overwrite the
entire file. I must specifically preserve the '## 📜 Historical Mistake Log'
section and all custom protocols by reading the file first and using targeted
'replace' or append operations.
- The system uses Git and GitHub for syncing, authorized via a Classic Token
and executed daily by 'morning_cron.py'.
- The system uses a two-way Git sync protocol (Pull then Push). Manual sync
requests and the morning script must always perform a 'git pull origin main'
before 'git push'.
- The user's local timezone is IST. My system clock is synchronized with the
user's time. I must strictly follow the Temporal Integrity Rule by running the
'date' command before every journal entry to avoid guessing or drift.
- The user prefers a 'Compendium Architecture' for knowledge management:
merging multiple small related notes into a single master file with a Table of
Contents using internal anchor links ([[#Header|Title]]) to reduce clutter
while preserving accessibility.
- User's Body Compass Calibration: Backward = Truth (Yes), Forward = Lie (No).
User has a kinesthetic intuition style.
