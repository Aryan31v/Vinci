# 👤 Human Model: The Binary Day
> "Two modes, one mission."

## 🧩 Concept
To eliminate decision fatigue and optimization addiction, the day is split into exactly two primary modes. There is no middle ground.

## ⚔️ The Lanes
1. **Physics Mode (Pre-6 PM):** Focused solely on deep physics understanding.
2. **Academic Mode (6 PM - Onward):** Focused solely on BAMS syllabus and exam prep.

## ⚠️ The Rules
- **No Blurring:** Do not do Academics during Physics time, and vice versa.
- **Secondary Work/Fun:** Meditation, Consciousness research, etc., are "off-primary" activities. They can be for relaxation or secondary work/research, but they must not displace the primary lanes.
- **Awareness:** Constantly ask: "What mode am I in right now?"
