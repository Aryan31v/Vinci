# 👤 Human Model: The Burning Ship Protocol
> "Retention through consequence."

## 🧩 Concept
Shallow organization creates an illusion of knowledge. Deep learning requires the brain to work for recall.

## ⚔️ The Protocol
1. Pick one learning goal per week.
2. Every Sunday, **Delete ALL notes** from that goal.
3. If you can't remember the key points from memory, you didn't learn it.
4. This forces high-intensity focus during the week because the "safety net" of the notes will be burned.
