# 👤 Human Model: The Closed Box Protocol
> "Execution without optimization."

## 🧩 Concept
To learn effectively, you must consume without the overhead of "System Building." Also known as **The Closed Loop** (Consume → Think → Move on).

## ⚔️ The Rules
1. **No Organizing:** While consuming, do not touch folders, tags, or note structures.
2. **No Researching Productivity:** No videos or articles on "how to learn [X]."
3. **Violation Penalty:** If you start organizing, close the laptop immediately. Sit with the discomfort for 5 minutes.
