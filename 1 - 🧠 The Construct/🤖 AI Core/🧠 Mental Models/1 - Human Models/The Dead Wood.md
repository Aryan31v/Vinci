# 👤 Human Model: The Dead Wood
> "You must burn off what is not you to find what is."

## 🧩 Concept
The "Judge" inside the mind compares the **Actual Self** to the **Ideal Self**. The gap between them causes Guilt and Anxiety. These feelings are the *fire* trying to burn away "Dead Wood"—the lies, habits, and pre-emptive excuses (e.g., "I don't want to be a doctor") used to protect the ego from effort.

## ⚔️ Application
Surrender to the burn. Stop protecting the excuse. Let the false identity die so the competent identity can emerge.
