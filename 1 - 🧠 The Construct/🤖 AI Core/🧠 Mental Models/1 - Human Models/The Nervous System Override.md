# 👤 Human Model: The Nervous System Override
> "The war is biological, not just psychological."

## 🧩 Concept
The feeling of "laziness" or "procrastination" is often a biological "Fight or Flight" response. When faced with a difficult, boring, or threatening task (e.g., Sanskrit), the nervous system perceives it as danger and triggers an **Escape Response** into dopamine-rich activities (Meta-Work, AI, Movies).

## ⚔️ Application
Do not try to "motivate" the mind with logic. Instead, train the body to sit in the fire.
- **Protocol:** [[1 - 🧠 The Construct/🤖 AI Core/🧬 Identity Matrix#⚔️ Learning & Focus|Tolerance Training]].
- **The Rep:** Finish the timer (25 mins) even if output is zero.
