# 👤 Human Model: The One Output Rule
> "Success is one thing understood, not one system built."

## 🧩 Concept
Optimization and organization are often sophisticated forms of procrastination. This model shifts the metric of success from "how much I organized" to "what I can explain."

## ⚔️ The Protocol
1. **The Question:** At the end of a session, ask: "Can I explain one new concept I learned today in plain English?"
2. **Output vs. Metadata:** A new folder, a tagged note, or a refined dashboard is **Metadata** (Zero value). An internal shift in understanding is **Output** (High value).
3. **The Feynman Check:** If you cannot explain it to a 5-year-old, the session was an optimization loop, not a learning session.
