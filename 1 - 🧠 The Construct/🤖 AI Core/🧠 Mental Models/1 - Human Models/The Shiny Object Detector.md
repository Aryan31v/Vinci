# 👤 Human Model: The Shiny Object Detector
> "Detecting procrastination with an alibi."

## 🧩 Concept
When anxiety about a difficult task (Sanskrit) spikes, the brain seeks a "Shiny Object" (AI, Hacking, New App) to feel productive without the pain. 

## ⚔️ The Filter
Ask:
1. Is this REQUIRED for a deadline?
2. Will I finish this session BEFORE my scheduled task?
3. Am I doing this because I'm anxious about the upcoming task?

**If any answer is NO → You are procrastinating.**
