# 👤 Human Model: The Solitude Window
> "Solitude is high-value capital."

## 🧩 Concept
Deep work and self-reconstruction require periods of zero observation. The "Solitude Window" is a rare asset where social friction is eliminated, allowing for maximum cognitive throughput.

## ⚔️ Application
Wasting a Solitude Window on "Meta-Work" (System tweaking) is a permanent loss of capital. Use these windows exclusively for the **Highest Value Task** (The "All In" work).
