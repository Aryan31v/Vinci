# ♻️ Relearning is Fast
> *"Nothing is truly lost."*

## 🧠 The Core Mechanic
Forgetting is not the deletion of data; it is an **Accessibility Failure.** Hermann Ebbinghaus showed that while we forget 70-80% of new info quickly, **relearning** that info takes a fraction of the original time. This is because the neural connections (the "paved road") still exist, even if they are covered in "weeds" (interference).

## ⚙️ The Cognitive Architecture
- **The Threshold Theory:** Memory strength exists on a scale (0-100). You can only "Recall" if strength is >50. If a memory drops to 45, it is "forgotten," but it only needs a tiny +5 boost to be "fully remembered." A new memory starts at 0 and needs a +50 boost.
- **Savings Score:** The difference in time between the 1st and 2nd learning sessions is the "Savings." This score is almost always positive, even after decades.
- **Gradient Descent:** In neural network terms, your brain has already found the "local minimum" (the solution). Re-finding it after a slight disturbance is faster than the initial descent.

## ⚠️ The "Forget-and-Panic" Trap
The fear of forgetting leads students to over-study or refuse to take breaks. This is energy-inefficient.
- **The Fix:** **Trust the Savings.** It is okay to let a subject (like a specific BAMS chapter) "go cold" for a few weeks. You aren't losing the time; you are just moving the data to "Cold Storage."

## 🛠️ Architect's Implementation
1.  **The Refresher Cycle:** Don't fear the Sanskrit shlokas you've forgotten. Set a 10-minute "Refresher" timer. You'll be shocked at how 80% comes back in 5 minutes.
2.  **Dormant Network Activation:** When starting a new Physics module related to an old one, spend 5 minutes skimming the old notes. "Heat up" the dormant network.
3.  **Long-Term Confidence:** Realize that every hour you spend learning *now* is a permanent deposit in your "Savings Account," even if you can't access it next month.
