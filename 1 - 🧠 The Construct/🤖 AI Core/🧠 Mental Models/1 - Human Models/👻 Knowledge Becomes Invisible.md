# 👻 Knowledge Becomes Invisible
> *"The Curse of Knowledge."*

## 🧠 The Core Mechanic
With practice, skills undergo **Automation.** They shift from the conscious Prefrontal Cortex (working memory) to the subconscious Basal Ganglia (procedural memory). This is essential for efficiency, but it makes the knowledge **Tacit** (invisible). You can do the skill, but you can no longer explain *how* you do it.

## ⚙️ The Cognitive Architecture
- **The Expert's Blind Spot:** Experts underestimate the difficulty of "basic" steps because those steps no longer require bandwidth. They literally "don't see" the complexity anymore.
- **Rigidity:** Automated skills are harder to modify. This is how you hit a "Plateau"—your automated solution is "good enough," so your brain stops seeking a better one.
- **De-automation:** To improve, you must consciously "break" your automaticity and move the skill back into working memory.

## ⚠️ The "Plateau" Trap
Once you are "good enough" at a skill (like reading or basic Sanskrit), you stop improving because the skill becomes invisible.
- **The Fix:** **Deliberate Challenge.** Force yourself into situations where your "automated" solution fails. This forces the brain to "see" the skill again and re-engineer it.

## 🛠️ Architect's Implementation
1.  **Teacher Mindset:** When you learn something, try to teach it to the AI. If you say "it's obvious," you've hit an invisible block. Deconstruct it.
2.  **Slow-Motion Practice:** Take a skill you're good at and do it at 10% speed. Notice the micro-movements or micro-decisions.
3.  **The Basic Audit:** Every month, re-study a "Basic" module in BAMS. You will see things you missed because they were "invisible" the first time.
