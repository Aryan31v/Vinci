# 💡 We Reason Through Examples
> *"Abstract logic is a secondary language. Examples are the native tongue."*

## 🧠 The Core Mechanic
Human reasoning is not based on "Formal Logic" (like a computer); it is based on **Mental Models.** According to Philip Johnson-Laird, we deduce truths by imagining a specific scenario (an example) and checking if the logic holds in that "world." We struggle with abstract rules because they require the construction of multiple competing mental models, which overloads our bandwidth.

## ⚙️ The Cognitive Architecture
- **The Wason Selection Task:** People fail logic puzzles with "A" and "4" but solve them perfectly when they are about "Drinking Age" and "Beer." We are socially and concretely wired.
- **Fluency Heuristic:** We mistake the **ease of recalling an example** for the probability of a fact. This is why a single vivid story often outweighs a mountain of statistics in our minds.
- **Example-Based Induction:** We learn the "General" by seeing the "Specific" many times.

## ⚠️ The "Abstraction" Trap
Trying to learn a concept via its definition or its mathematical formula first is the slowest path. Definitions are "compressed" information; you cannot decompress them without the "key" (examples).
- **The Fix:** **Example-First Learning.** Find 3 concrete examples *before* reading the formal definition.

## 🛠️ Architect's Implementation
1.  **The Case-Study Method:** When studying Ayurveda (BAMS), don't just memorize the "Dosha" list. Read a case study of a person with that Dosha. The example is the hook.
2.  **Analogy Engineering:** Explain every Physics concept as a "Human Story" or a "Social Interaction." (e.g., "Entropy is a messy room").
3.  **The "Anti-Example":** To define what something IS, find an example of what it IS NOT. This clarifies the boundaries of the mental model.
