# 📈 Knowledge Grows Exponentially
> *"The more you know, the easier it is to learn."*

## 🧠 The Core Mechanic
Knowledge is not a stack of facts; it is a **Semantic Network.** New information is integrated by forming connections to existing knowledge structures ("Schemas"). The more schemas you have, the more "hooks" are available for new information to latch onto. This creates a "Matthew Effect" (the rich get richer) in cognitive acquisition.

## ⚙️ The Cognitive Architecture
- **The Crystal Seed:** Learning is like crystallization. An initial "seed" of knowledge is hard to form, but once established, the crystal grows rapidly as new molecules attach to the existing lattice.
- **Prior Knowledge Dominance:** Research shows that prior knowledge of a topic is a better predictor of learning speed than general IQ. Your "hooks" are more powerful than your "processing speed."
- **Associative Shifting:** As the network grows, the brain shifts from learning "Facts" to learning "Relationships," which are more stable and easier to store.

## ⚠️ The "Initial Dip" Trap
The start of any new subject (Sanskrit, Physics) is objectively the most difficult phase. Because you have zero "hooks," every piece of info feels heavy and slippery.
- **The Danger:** Many quit during this phase, assuming they are "bad at it," when they are simply in the "Low-Hook Phase."
- **The Fix:** Acknowledge the "Stupid Phase." Accept low retention for the first 10-20 hours while you build the scaffolding.

## 🛠️ Architect's Implementation
1.  **Scaffold Building:** In BAMS, master the "Terminologies" first. They are the hooks for the entire syllabus.
2.  **Cross-Linking:** When learning Physics, find a "hook" in Meditation or Sanskrit. Force an association to make the new info stick.
3.  **The "Snowball" Review:** Periodically review the fundamentals to ensure your "hooks" are sharp. If the base decays, the exponential growth stops.
