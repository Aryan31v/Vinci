# 🔋 Mental Bandwidth is Limited
> *"The bottleneck of the mind."*

## 🧠 The Core Mechanic
Working memory—the "scratchpad" of the mind—is extremely limited. While early theories suggested "7 +/- 2" items, modern research points to a bottleneck of approximately **4 items.** All learning, logic, and experience must pass through this narrow funnel to reach long-term memory. Subliminal learning is a myth; if it doesn't pass through the attentional bottleneck, it isn't learned.

## ⚙️ The Cognitive Architecture
- **Cognitive Load Theory:** Total cognitive load = **Intrinsic** (complexity of topic) + **Extraneous** (bad design/distractions) + **Germane** (actual learning work). Learning fails when Intrinsic + Extraneous > 4.
- **The Attention Choke:** Irrelevant information (noise) consumes slots in the working memory, pushing out the useful data.
- **Chunking:** The only way to bypass the limit. By grouping items (e.g., "S-H-I-V-A" -> "SHIVA"), you turn 5 items into 1 item, freeing up 3 slots.

## ⚠️ The "Split Attention" Trap
Trying to look at a complex diagram while reading a separate text description forces the brain to "switch" and "hold" both, causing immediate overload.
- **The Fix:** Integrate your sources. Put the labels *on* the diagram. Don't flip between pages.

## 🛠️ Architect's Implementation
1.  **Isolate the Variable:** When learning a complex Sanskrit rule, ignore the vocabulary. Use simple words you already know so your bandwidth is 100% on the *rule*.
2.  **Worked Examples:** For beginners, "Problem Solving" is a waste of bandwidth. You spend all your slots "searching" and none "learning." Use **Worked Examples** (solved problems) to see the pattern first.
3.  **The "Dump" Rule:** Never try to hold a list in your head. Write it in the `Chaos Stream`. Offload the storage so the bandwidth can be used for *processing*.
