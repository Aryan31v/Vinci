# 🧩 Problem Solving is Search
> *"To solve a problem is to find a path through a maze."*

## 🧠 The Core Mechanic
Problem solving is the navigation of a **"Problem Space."** According to the work of Herbert Simon and Allen Newell (*Human Problem Solving*), every challenge consists of a starting state, a recognizable goal state, and a set of constraints (the "walls" of the maze). When you lack a direct memory or algorithm for a solution, your brain reverts to **searching** through the space of possibilities.

## ⚙️ The Cognitive Architecture
- **State Space Navigation:** You are moving through configurations. In a Rubik's Cube, every twist is a move in the state space.
- **Rules as Constraints:** The "walls" are the logic of the system (e.g., Sanskrit grammar rules, physical laws).
- **Search Reduction:** Expertise is not "better searching"; it is the acquisition of **Patterns** that allow you to prune the search tree. You stop looking at the dead ends because you "see" the walls before you hit them.

## ⚠️ The "Brute Force" Trap
Without prior knowledge, your brain uses **Brute Force Search** (trying everything). This is why learning a new subject feels exhausting—you are doing massive computational work with zero efficiency. 
- **Symptoms:** Confusion, "running in circles," and high cognitive drain.
- **The Fix:** Stop searching and start **Pattern Loading.** Study solved examples to "see" the paths.

## 🛠️ Architect's Implementation
1.  **Map the Walls:** Before solving, define the constraints clearly. What are the "rules of the game" for this BAMS module?
2.  **Pattern Injection:** Instead of struggling with a blank page, review 5 solved problems/cases first. Load the "paths" into your working memory.
3.  **Search Pruning:** Use heuristics. Ask: "What is the most likely 'next state' based on first principles?"
