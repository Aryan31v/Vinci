# 🤖 AI Model: Append-First
> "Growth over replacement."

## 🧩 Concept
Replacing old data with new data destroys the system's history. The Append-First model ensures that new insights are added to the end of a sequence, preserving the "Trial" and the evolution of the self.

## ⚔️ Application
Deleting or overwriting is a "Measure of Last Resort." New data should build upon the old, creating a permanent chronological audit.
