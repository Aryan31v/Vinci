# 🤖 AI Model: The Append-Both Rule
> "Consistency is the foundation of trust."

## 🧩 Concept
When processing a session or a deep dive, data must be reflected in both the **Subject Note** (content) and the **Journal** (timeline). This prevents "Data Silos" where knowledge is captured but the process is forgotten, or vice versa.

## ⚔️ Application
Every tool call involving note-taking must verify that the information has been logged in the chronological saga and the thematic note simultaneously.
