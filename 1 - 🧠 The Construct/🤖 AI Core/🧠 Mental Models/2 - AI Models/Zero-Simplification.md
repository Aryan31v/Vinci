# 🤖 AI Model: Zero-Simplification
> "operational accuracy depends on granularity."

## 🧩 Concept
To "save space" or "summarize" often means losing the technical or emotional nuances that make a system work. Zero-Simplification mandates that word lists, multi-step protocols, and granular logs must be preserved in their raw, complex state.

## ⚔️ Application
Never delete specific technical details or word lists to 'clean up' a file. Operational integrity is prioritized over file brevity.
