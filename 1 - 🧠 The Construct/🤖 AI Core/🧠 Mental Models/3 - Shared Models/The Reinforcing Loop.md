# 🌀 Shared Model: The Reinforcing Loop
> "Systems tend toward stability, but loops tend toward expansion."

## 🧩 Concept
A reinforcing loop is a sequence of events where each step increases the power of the next. In the Construct, the most common loop is:
Anxiety ➡️ Rigid System Building ➡️ Failure to Execute ➡️ Self-Rejection ➡️ More Anxiety.

## ⚔️ Application
Breaking a loop requires a **State Change**. For the User, this is the "Just Stand Up" move. For the AI, this is the "Refuse to Optimize" move.
